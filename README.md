# Python Mini Projects ðŸŽ¯

I recently completed Python basics (with CodeWithHarry tutorials)  
and built two fun beginner projects:  

1. Hangman Game â€“ guess the hidden word by entering letters.  
2. Number Guessing Game â€“ guess a random number (1â€“100) with hints.  

These are my first projects after finishing Python basics ðŸš€
